# Modal_Window

This quick project is to demonstate my ability to manipulate classes with JavaScript.

Please press any Modal button. Notice the bachground blur and functioning 'X' button. Also try clicking outside of the Modal window, that is an alternitive way to close the pop up window. There is one more way to close out the window... and that is through the Escape key.

This is a very simple project, and it is not a lot of code. But it is a good demonstration of how proper class manipulation can result in displaying windows and text content in the browser.

Enjoy.
